#ALGORITHMS
#1 What is an algorithm?
# An exact step-by-step procedure with instructions for solving a problem
# in programming we write algorithms before writing the code that solves a problem. This is for clarity.

#2 What is pseudocode?
# Pseudocode is a way of writing down the steps of an algorithm in plain, simple language

#3What other way of writing down the steps of an algorithm?
# creating a structure diagram or flowchart

#4 give an example of Pseudocode for a program we will write, which reads a positive integer n and calculates the sum 1+2+3+...+n.
#1. Input a positive integer n
#2  Use a variable sum and Set it to 0. and a counter k and set it to 1.
#   repeat the two rows as long as k is less than or equal to n
#3      increase sum with k
#       increase k with one
#4 print sum as a result

#5What is stepwise refinement during the construction of programs?
# It means breaking down a problem into smaller and smaller steps until each step is simple enough to translate directly into code
# solve each problem by itself , and brak down into even smaller problems ,continue until all pratproblems are solved
# start with a big algorithm, then get smaller
